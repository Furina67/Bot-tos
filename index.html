    <div class="card">
        <h3>1. Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Furina</strong> collects, uses,
            and protects data when used in Discord servers. The bot operates only
            within servers where it is explicitly invited and does not function
            outside of Discord.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>2. Data Collected</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User, Server, and Channel IDs</strong> required for core functionality</li>
            <li><strong>Message content</strong> for moderation commands, AFK systems,
                counting channels, and deleted message sniping</li>
            <li><strong>Member data</strong> such as roles, nicknames, and join/leave state</li>
            <li><strong>Optional presence data</strong> for opt-in, status-based role features</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The bot does not read or process direct messages.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>3. How Data Is Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Executing prefix commands and interactions</li>
            <li>Moderation and server management</li>
            <li>Utility tools, giveaways, and games</li>
            <li>Optional AI-powered responses when explicitly requested by users</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Data is not used for advertising, profiling, analytics, or training
            machine learning models.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>4. Data Storage and Retention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Message content</strong> may be temporarily stored in a local JSON
                file only for moderation-related features such as deleted message sniping.
                Stored message content is limited in scope and automatically deleted after
                a maximum of <strong>30 days</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI command memory</strong> is stored only in short-term runtime
                memory to provide conversational context and is cleared automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Configuration data</strong> (such as server settings) may be stored
                to support persistent functionality.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>
            The bot does not sell or share user data with third parties.
            AI-powered commands send user-provided input to a third-party AI service
            (Google Gemini) <strong>only</strong> when a user explicitly invokes an AI command.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>6. User Control and Opt-Out</h3>
        <p>

            Users may request deletion of stored moderation-related data by contacting
            the bot developer.
        </p>
    </div>
